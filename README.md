# Data Assimilation for Orszag-Tang MHD Vortex Problem
## Introduction
This is a github repostory for the research project "Data assimilation for Orszag-Tang Magnetohydrodynamic Vortex Problem". Here, FDM based 2D MHD simulation code and EnKF are developed to estimate the nonlinear dynamics for 2D MHD environment where the measurement noise and the process noise exist in the system.

## Background
### MHD and Orszag-Tnag MHD vortex

### Ensemble Kalman Filter

## Estimation of the dynamics with EnKF
### Methodolgoies

### Numerical results
